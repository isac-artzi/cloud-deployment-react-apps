## Introduction

Welcome to this hands-on tutorial! You're about to build a **complete deep learning application** that runs entirely in your web browser. No backend servers, no Python, no complex setup - just React and TensorFlow.js.

### What You'll Build

A handwritten digit recognition app that:
- Lets users draw digits (0-9) on a canvas
- Trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in the browser
- Makes real-time predictions as you draw
- Displays probability distributions for all digits

### Technologies Used

- **React**: UI framework for building interactive interfaces
- **TensorFlow.js**: Machine learning library for JavaScript
- **Canvas API**: For drawing and image processing
- **Modern JavaScript**: ES6+, async/await, hooks

---

## Prerequisites

### Required Knowledge

- **JavaScript Basics**: Variables, functions, arrays, objects
- **React Fundamentals**: Components, props, state (helpful but not required)
- **Command Line**: Basic terminal/command prompt usage

### Required Software

1. **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
   - Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
   - Verify installation: `node --version`

2. **npm** (comes with Node.js)
   - Verify installation: `npm --version`

3. **Code Editor** (recommended)
   - Visual Studio Code
   - Sublime Text
   - Atom

4. **Modern Web Browser**
   - Chrome (recommended)
   - Firefox
   - Edge
   - Safari

---

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Navigate to Project Directory

```bash
cd /Users/sensym/Documents/AIT-204-cloud-deployment
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

This command installs all required packages (React, TensorFlow.js, etc.):

```bash
npm install
```

**What gets installed:**
- `react` & `react-dom`: React library
- `@tensorflow/tfjs`: TensorFlow.js for machine learning
- `react-scripts`: Development tools and build system

**Expected output:**
```
added 1234 packages in 45s
```

### Step 3: Start Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

**What happens:**
1. Compiles your React application
2. Starts a local development server
3. Opens your browser automatically to `http://localhost:3000`

**Expected output:**
```
Compiled successfully!

You can now view react-deep-learning-tutorial in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000
  On Your Network:  http://192.168.1.100:3000
```

### Step 4: Verify Everything Works

In your browser, you should see:
- A gradient purple/blue header with title
- Three cards: "Model Training", "Draw Here", "Predictions"
- A "Train Model" button

## How It Works

### Part 1: Model Creation (`modelUtils.js`)

#### Neural Network Architecture

```javascript
createModel() {
  Input Layer        [28, 28, 1]  // 28x28 grayscale image
       ↓
  Conv2D Layer       [24, 24, 8]  // 8 filters, 5x5 kernel
       ↓
  MaxPooling         [12, 12, 8]  // 2x2 pooling
       ↓
  Conv2D Layer       [8, 8, 16]   // 16 filters, 5x5 kernel
       ↓
  MaxPooling         [4, 4, 16]   // 2x2 pooling
       ↓
  Flatten            [256]         // Convert to 1D
       ↓
  Dense Layer        [128]         // Fully connected
       ↓
  Output Layer       [10]          // 10 digits (0-9)
       ↓
  Softmax            [10]          // Probabilities
}
```

#### What Each Layer Does

**Conv2D (Convolutional Layer)**
- Learns to detect features (edges, curves, patterns)
- Uses small filters that slide across the image
- Example: One filter might learn to detect vertical lines

**MaxPooling**
- Reduces image size (downsampling)
- Makes the model more robust to small shifts
- Keeps the most important information

**Dense (Fully Connected)**
- Combines features to make final decision
- Every neuron connects to every neuron in previous layer

**Softmax**
- Converts raw scores to probabilities
- Output sums to 1.0 (100%)
- Example: [0.05, 0.02, 0.01, 0.85, 0.01, ...]
  - Digit 3 has 85% probability

### Part 2: Training Process

```javascript
trainModel() {
  For each epoch (1 to 10):
    For each batch of 64 images:
      1. Feed images through network (Forward pass)
      2. Compare predictions to true labels (Calculate loss)
      3. Adjust weights to reduce loss (Backward pass)
      4. Update UI with progress
}
```

#### Training Metrics

**Loss**
- Measures how wrong predictions are
- Lower is better
- Goal: Minimize loss

**Accuracy**
- Percentage of correct predictions
- Higher is better
- Training accuracy: Performance on training data
- Validation accuracy: Performance on unseen data

**Example Training Output:**
```
Epoch 1/10
  Loss: 0.8523
  Training Accuracy: 72.45%
  Validation Accuracy: 74.21%

Epoch 5/10
  Loss: 0.2154
  Training Accuracy: 93.67%
  Validation Accuracy: 92.88%

Epoch 10/10
  Loss: 0.0943
  Training Accuracy: 97.23%
  Validation Accuracy: 96.54%
```

### Part 3: Making Predictions

```javascript
// When user draws on canvas:
handleCanvasChange(canvas) {
  // 1. Preprocess the image
  const tensor = preprocessCanvas(canvas);
  // Converts drawing to 28x28 grayscale tensor
  // Normalizes pixel values to [0, 1]

  // 2. Make prediction
  const result = predict(model, tensor);
  // Feeds tensor through trained model
  // Gets probabilities for each digit

  // 3. Update UI
  setPrediction(result);
  // Shows predicted digit and confidence

  // 4. Clean up
  tensor.dispose();
  // Prevents memory leaks
}
```

## Running the Application

### Step-by-Step Usage Guide

#### 1. Start the App
```bash
npm start
```
Wait for browser to open to `http://localhost:3000`

#### 2. Train the Model
- Click the **"Train Model"** button
- Watch the progress bar
- Wait 30-60 seconds for training to complete
- You'll see accuracy metrics updating in real-time

#### 3. Draw a Digit
- Use your mouse (or finger on touchscreen)
- Draw any digit from 0 to 9 in the canvas
- The model makes predictions as you draw!

#### 4. View Results
- See the predicted digit (large number)
- Check the confidence score (percentage)
- Examine probability bars for all digits

#### 5. Try Again
- Click **"Clear Canvas"**
- Draw a different digit
- Compare how confident the model is

### Expected Behavior

**Good Predictions** (high confidence):
- Clear, centered digits
- Similar to how the model was trained
- Example: Drawing "3" shows 95%+ confidence

**Uncertain Predictions** (low confidence):
- Messy or unclear drawings
- Digits that look like multiple numbers
- Example: Drawing looks like both "7" and "1"

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue 1: "npm: command not found"
**Cause**: Node.js not installed or not in PATH

**Solution:**
1. Download Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Install and restart terminal
3. Verify: `node --version` and `npm --version`

---

#### Issue 2: "Port 3000 already in use"
**Cause**: Another app is using port 3000

**Solution:**
```bash
# Option 1: Use different port
PORT=3001 npm start

# Option 2: Kill process on port 3000 (Mac/Linux)
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# Option 2: Kill process on port 3000 (Windows)
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

---

#### Issue 3: Training is very slow
**Cause**: Running on CPU instead of GPU, or large dataset

**Solution:**
1. Reduce training data size in `modelUtils.js`:
   ```javascript
   const trainDataSize = 1000; // Instead of 5000
   ```
2. Reduce epochs:
   ```javascript
   const epochs = 5; // Instead of 10
   ```
3. Use Chrome (better WebGL support)

---

#### Issue 4: "Out of memory" error
**Cause**: TensorFlow.js tensors not being disposed

**Solution:**
1. Wrap tensor operations in `tf.tidy()`:
   ```javascript
   const result = tf.tidy(() => {
     // Tensors created here are auto-disposed
     return model.predict(input);
   });
   ```
2. Manually dispose tensors:
   ```javascript
   tensor.dispose();
   ```

---

#### Issue 5: Predictions are always wrong
**Cause**: Model not trained, or drawing doesn't match training data

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure you clicked "Train Model" and waited for completion
2. Draw digits clearly and centered
3. Try drawing slowly and carefully
4. Check console for errors: F12 → Console tab

---

#### Issue 6: Canvas not responding to mouse
**Cause**: Event listeners not set up correctly

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify `canvasRef.current` is not null
3. Try refreshing the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)

---

#### Issue 7: App doesn't update after code changes
**Cause**: Hot reload failed

**Solution:**
1. Save the file again (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)
2. Refresh browser manually
3. Restart dev server:
   ```bash
   # Press Ctrl+C to stop
   npm start # Start again
   ```
