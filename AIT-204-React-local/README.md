# React Deep Learning Tutorial: Browser-Based Handwritten Digit Recognition

## 🎓 Tutorial Overview

Welcome to this hands-on tutorial! You'll build a **complete deep learning application** that runs entirely in your browser—no backend server required. By the end, you'll have a React app that can recognize handwritten digits using a neural network.

### What You'll Learn

1. **React Fundamentals**: Component structure, state management, and hooks
2. **TensorFlow.js**: Running machine learning models in the browser
3. **Deep Learning Basics**: Neural networks, training, and predictions
4. **Canvas API**: Drawing and image processing in the browser
5. **Real-time ML**: Making predictions as users interact with your app

### Why No Backend?

Modern browsers are powerful enough to run machine learning models! TensorFlow.js lets you:
- Train models directly in the browser using WebGL acceleration
- Load pre-trained models and run inference
- Process data completely client-side (privacy-friendly!)
- Create interactive ML experiences without server costs

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** or **yarn** package manager
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari)
- Basic understanding of JavaScript and React

### Installation Steps

1. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/sensym/Documents/AIT-204-cloud-deployment
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This will install:
   - `react` and `react-dom` - UI framework
   - `@tensorflow/tfjs` - Machine learning library
   - Other development tools

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open your browser**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
   - You should see the digit recognition app!

## 🧠 How It Works: The Deep Learning Pipeline

### Step 1: Data Preparation
The app uses the **MNIST dataset** (70,000 handwritten digits, 0-9). Each image is 28x28 pixels.

```javascript
// Data is normalized to [0, 1] range
// Labels are one-hot encoded:
//   "3" becomes [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

### Step 2: Model Architecture
We build a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**:

```
Input (28x28 grayscale image)
    ↓
Conv2D Layer (8 filters, 5x5 kernel) + ReLU
    ↓
MaxPooling (2x2)
    ↓
Conv2D Layer (16 filters, 5x5 kernel) + ReLU
    ↓
MaxPooling (2x2)
    ↓
Flatten
    ↓
Dense Layer (128 neurons) + ReLU
    ↓
Dense Layer (10 neurons) + Softmax → Probabilities for digits 0-9
```

### Step 3: Training
The model learns by:
1. Making predictions on training images
2. Comparing predictions to true labels (cross-entropy loss)
3. Adjusting weights using the Adam optimizer
4. Repeating for multiple epochs

### Step 4: Inference
When you draw a digit:
1. Canvas data is captured as image
2. Image is resized to 28x28 and normalized
3. Model predicts probabilities for each digit (0-9)
4. Highest probability is the prediction!

- **Clear** button to start over
- Real-time prediction as you draw

### Model Training
- **Live training progress** with accuracy metrics
- **Epoch-by-epoch updates** showing learning
- **Validation accuracy** to prevent overfitting

### Prediction Display
- **Probability bars** showing confidence for each digit
- **Visual feedback** highlighting the predicted digit
- **Confidence scores** in percentage

## 🔧 Customization Ideas for Students

### Beginner Level
1. **Change the UI colors**: Modify `App.css` to match your style
2. **Adjust canvas size**: Make the drawing area bigger/smaller
3. **Add a save drawing button**: Let users download their drawings

### Intermediate Level
4. **Add more training data**: Augment data with rotations/shifts
5. **Visualize filters**: Show what the CNN layers learn
6. **Add a probability threshold**: Only show predictions above X% confidence

### Advanced Level
7. **Multi-digit recognition**: Detect and classify multiple digits
8. **Custom datasets**: Train on letters (A-Z) instead of digits
9. **Transfer learning**: Use a pre-trained model and fine-tune it
10. **Model comparison**: Train different architectures and compare performance

## 📊 Understanding TensorFlow.js

### Key Concepts

**Tensors**: Multi-dimensional arrays (like NumPy arrays)
```javascript
const tensor = tf.tensor2d([[1, 2], [3, 4]]);
```

**Layers**: Building blocks of neural networks
```javascript
tf.layers.dense({ units: 128, activation: 'relu' })
```

**Training Loop**: Automatic with `model.fit()`
```javascript
await model.fit(images, labels, {
  epochs: 10,
  callbacks: { onEpochEnd: (epoch, logs) => {...} }
});
```

**Memory Management**: TensorFlow.js requires cleanup
```javascript
tf.tidy(() => {
  // Tensors created here are auto-disposed
});
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Out of memory" errors
- **Cause**: TensorFlow.js doesn't auto-cleanup tensors
- **Solution**: Use `tf.tidy()` or manually call `tensor.dispose()`

### Canvas not detecting mouse
- **Cause**: Incorrect event listener setup
- **Solution**: Check that `getBoundingClientRect()` is called correctly

### Model training is slow
- **Cause**: Large batch size or too many epochs
- **Solution**: Reduce batch size to 32 or train fewer epochs initially

### Predictions are random
- **Cause**: Model not trained yet
- **Solution**: Wait for training to complete before drawing
